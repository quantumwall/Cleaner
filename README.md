# Cleaner
Clean work directory
A program that can be used to clean the working directory on a schedule or manually. 
1. You need to create a jar file (for example from the NetBeans IDE or from the command line)
2. Run the application from the java command line "java -jar arg1 arg2... argN", where arg1 is the path to the directory (if Windows is in the format Disk:/path/to/directory or Disk:\\path\\to\\directory). Files that contain arg2, ...argN in the name will be deleted
3. In the future I plan to implement the graphical interface of the application.
Of course, it would be much easier to make a simple script for Windows and Linux, package it in bat or sh files and use these scripts on your systems. Java allows you to write the same code for different systems. In addition, I am learning Java, so the choice was obvious))
The program is written with Java 17, but I don't think there will be problems when using older versions.
